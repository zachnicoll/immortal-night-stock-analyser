# Immortal Night Stock Analyser
A small Python program that gathers the "stock market" data from the browser game Immortal Night, and displays a graph for each share and its general trend.

To run this program you must download Python from https://www.python.org/, and install the following packages via pip and the command prompt:

Beautiful Soup - type 'pip install bs4' into Windows Command Prompt to install this package.
MatPlotLib - type 'pip install matplotlib' into Windows Command Prompt to install this package.
Numpy - type 'pip install numpy' into Windows Command Prompt to install this package.

Once these packages have been installed, simply run the program with Python and enjoy :)

FUNCTIONALITY:
 - Ticking the "Hold Graphs" button will stop the graphs from closing when you open another. Use this feature to analyse multiple graphs at once.
 - Typing a number into the "(Optional) Enter Share Price Bought At" input box will display a horizontal dotted line on the graph of the price you bought the share. This allows you to detemrine if the current share price is above or below the price you bought it at.
 - Click the "Quit" button to close the program and all open graphs. Exiting via the X in the top right hand corner of the window does not close all graphs.
 
 If requested or suggested, features may be added to this program, however this was just a small project that I had fun making, and hopefully it serves you some purpose!
